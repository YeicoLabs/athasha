- Monitored parsers to store expose the available points (and other features), to implement point pickers. Modbus items would expose their available points even when not runner yet.
- Raise even on normal runner exit: defensive?
- UUID for item ids
- Screen designer
- Widget designer and publisher: cloud, svg, liveview?...
- Simple table based point viewer
- Data viewer (from database)
- REST/WS point exporter
- Separated page editors
- Code editor/runner (like notebook)
- Backup/restore individual items
- Clone selected item
- Replace sniff with sport (security and no polling)
- Multi database support for database runner
- Shared queues, stacks, maps, ...
- Native PLC drivers: AB, Fanuc, Siemens, ...
- Modbus ASCII support
- Output IO support for modbus runner
- Opto22 native driver runner (module + point addresses, edge detectors, counters, ...)
- Sandbox runner dependencies: Tds, Baud, ...
- Runners on their own beam node or port
- SharpTerminal/SharpMaster similar tools
- Modbus slave editor / viewer
- USB serial ports persistent names
- Bluetooth + smartphone setup
- Windows installer and config editor (port / password)
- Precompiled plugin repository
- Pre Built port based plugin drivers
- Plugin = module + native port (c/c++/go/rust)
- Channel manager clone
- Multi project/user
- Hide action links until item selected
- Item status/log viewer (popup?)
- Per device custom function code names (avoid cryptic ones)
- Disable/enable all action
